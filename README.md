# Task Tracker

This project was made following the Angular Crash Course by Traversy Media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8) in order to learn and exercise Angular.

It wasn't meant to be published on GitHub in the first place, but I want to update it in the future. It's a very good course and combined with documentation it is perfect to learn basics in Angular.
